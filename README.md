# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project 

Before everything else, download the project data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

After doing that, unzip the zipfile keeping the same names as in the original file.

You should get a folder named UCI HAR Dataset. Put that folder in a folder of your choice and add the run_analysis.R
script to that same folder with the UCI HAR Dataset inside.

Run the script. The result will be a tidy_data.txt file that will contain the data ordered and cleaned as asked in the course rubric

R version used was: 3.2.0 with packages tidyr and dplyr (script includes installation of those packages)
